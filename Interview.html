    <h2> Let's chit chat! </h2>


    <hr>
    <h4> 1. What's your favorite way to exercise not in a gym setting? (swimming, hiking, etc.),</h4>
<p>This may sound super simple, but walking! We LOVE getting our steps in, and find that this super low impact "workout" that comes naturally as we go about our days (we try to Uber as little as possible) has amazing results. We are also huge fans of hiking, especially when on the west coast!</p>

<h4>2. All time favorite smoothie recipe?</h4>
<p>Our super filling GG cracker smoothie! 2 GG crackers, a ton of greens (we love Kale and/or spinach!), scoop of almond butter, raw cacao nibs, cinnamon + water, almond milk and ice for desired thickness.</p>

<h4>3. Almond butter or peanut butter?</h4>
<p>Almond butter 100p.</p>

<h4>4. Advice you would give your younger self at the beginning of your health/ fitness journey?</h4>
<p>You don't have to kill yourself for a beautiful body! We used to think we had to do a ton of HIIT, spinning + high impact workouts in order to see results, and it's actually been quite the opposite. Every body is different, and everyone's preferences are different.</p>

<h4>5. Which country or city that you've traveled to had the best healthy food?</h4>
<a href=""https://sweatsandcity.com/sweat/where-to-work-out-in-la/>LA</a>, no question!</p>

<h4>6. Favorite health/ fitness guru that you're loving right now?</h4>
<p>We really admire Kelly LeVeque of @bewellbykelly, Anna Kaiser of AKT, and Kirsty Godso!</p>

<h4>7. What time do you typically wake up?</h4>
<p>It depends on the day, but typically 7/7:30am. We almost always beat our alarms.</p>

<h4>8. If you could have one sweet treat for the rest of your life what would it be?</h4>
<p> Dale: Tie between GoGreek froyo and Van Leeuwen honeycomb ice cream!</p>
<p> Eliz: Cultures froyo in NYC ... we have a bit of a froyo obsession. Cultures has the best, creamiest froyo IMO.</p>

<h4>9. Favorite place to shop for athletic wear?</h4>
<p>Six:02

<h4>10. Waffles or pancakes?</h4>
<p>Waffles! With Paleo Passion Foods granola on top :)</P>

<h3>Best,</h3>
